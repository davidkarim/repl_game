<h1>First Assignment: REPL Game</h1>

This first assignment was to make a REPL game (read-evaluate-print-loop). This REPL Game is a brief experience through a castle. I 
chose to implement an auto-complete function which enhances the user experience by looking through the options and populating the 
input field with a choice. The functionality is very similar to what most users are now accustomed to seeing in web forms and 
Google searches.
